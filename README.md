Want to help me make this thing? Feel free to add/suggest whatever! Currently looking for people who know about the following areas:
- reliable long-running programs
- safe un-hackable programs (esp. with money stuff)
- money stuff (getting and logging incoming funds and sending them out to the right places)
- data viz
- UI/UX
- twitch overlays

## Reading List
- *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins
- *Joyful Militancy* by carla bergman and Nick Montgomery
- Epigenetic Trauma (podcast -- research further)
